## 476. [Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all
the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.

* For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its complement is `"010"` which is the
  integer `2`.

Given an integer `num`, return *its complement*.

##### Examples

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> num = 5
<b>Output:</b> 2
<b>Explanation:</b> The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), 
and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> num = 1
<b>Output:</b> 0
<b>Explanation:</b> The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), 
and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
</pre>

##### Constraints

* <code>1 <= num < 2<sup>31</sup></code>
