## 409. [Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/)

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return *the length of the
**longest palindrome*** that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

##### Examples

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> s = "abccccdd"
<b>Output:</b> 7
<b>Explanation:</b> One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> s = "a"
<b>Output:</b> 1
<b>Explanation:</b> The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
</pre>

##### Constraints

* <code>1 <= s.length <= 2000</code>
* `s` consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.
